# Untangle (v2)

Content grows on-demand as parts of v1 get merged, currently at about 20%

## Welcome to the Wonderful World of fractal logic and computing

_This might be a good spot to break the loop_

All our logic operators share a common component.  
Better worded, all our logic operators are derived from a single operator: the fractal switch.

The fractal world is all about inheritance and transformation.  
Binary values are transformations of a shared reference value: null.

Because there is just a single operator and single value, both can be removed from the equation/system.  
What's left is structure in the form of information and connection.

These structures are self-modifying and `untangle` is their containment field.  
`untangle` isolates and extracts the essence of information.

What `untangle` does is:

  - transform logic expressions into fractal structures
  - let structures digest information
  - solve equations by extracting information

### Time trail

Untangle is a large project developed over many years.  
The previous version (v1.50) is a working small-scale prototype.  
Feedback revealed a fundamental assumption being invalid.  
About choosing a representative structure/expression from a group of synonyms.  
Smaller is not always better and sometimes even makes it worse.

Version 2 is a rewrite and possibly the first large-scale pre-production platform.  
Version 1.50 will be imported in parts and rewritten with the new paradigm in mind.  
Attention goes all over the place in a non-linear fashion.  
To aid future documentation, a trail of "@date" tokens are used as markers.  
Names, descriptions and comments may refer to future explanations.

## History

This is a rewrite from scratch of version 1.35 and 1.50.
The merging of both failed at a critical moment due to personal reasons.
Also, a number of fundamental issues that were starting to backfire needed to be fixed.

In total there are 6 normalisation levels and the project that needed these fractal structures.

## Requirements

*   64-bits CPU architecture.
