Connection of terms and codewords used. 
Some may have an extended or alternative meaning to traditional terminology.

* `4n9` / `5n9`

    General form being `<#nodes>`n`<#variables>`
     
    Dataset of micro-fractals consisting of max 4 `QTF` operators and 9 variables. 

* footprint
 
   Bit vector containing the results of the micro-fractal evaluations for all different variable possibilities.

* imprint
 
   Extension of `footprint` including all possible variable permutations.
   
* kstart / istart / ostart / istart / nstart

   Tree indices indicating the start of variable groups with specific higher-level semantics.

   The values are constrained to `kstart` <= `istart` <= `ostart` <= `ustart` <= `nstart` 
 
   The range `"kstart <= x <= nstart"` is considered input which is excluded when evaluated.
   Node evaluation start from `nstart`.
   Evaluation results are generally stored in the output vector `"roots[]"`
   
   Historically `K` stands for Key, `I` for input, `O` for output, `U` for user-defined and `N` for nodes.

* `QTF` / `QnTF` / `QTnF`

   `QTF` representing `Q ? T : F` where `T` and/or `F` can be inverted.
   
   `QnTF` representing `Q ? ~T : F` where T is always inverted and F is never inverted
   
   `QTnF` representing `Q ? T : ~F` where T is never inverted and T is always inverted
